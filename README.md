# Blinkit-Analysis-SQL-PowerBI-Python-

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Blinkit sales and customer data** using Python, SQL, and Power BI.  
The goal was to explore patterns, clean and transform the dataset, and build an interactive dashboard to generate insights for business decision-making.  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** → Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis  
- **SQL** → Writing queries to extract insights from raw data  
- **Power BI** → Data cleaning (Power Query) and dashboard creation for visualization  

---

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Imported raw Blinkit dataset
   - Cleaned missing and inconsistent values using:
     - Python (Pandas, Numpy)
     - Power Query (in Power BI)

2. **Exploratory Analysis (Python)**
   - Checked data distribution
   - Identified key KPIs (Sales, Item Count, Ratings, etc.)

3. **SQL Analysis**
   - Wrote queries to extract business insights:
     - Top-selling categories
     - Revenue trends
     - Customer preferences
     - Ratings and reviews analysis

4. **Dashboard (Power BI)**
   - Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** with slicers and KPIs
   - Included charts for:
     - Sales by Item Category
     - Ratings distribution
     - Average Sales per Item
     - Monthly revenue trends
